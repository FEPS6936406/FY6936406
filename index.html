  For many years, innovation has been the foundation to Formula One motor racing. Over&#10; the past few decades,Formula One has had innovations that had revolutionised and shaped&#10; the sport for decades to come and have been implemented ever since.&#10; However, some innovations have been banned due to safety, the sole dominance of one team or cost effectiveness. This presentati ; banned.

  <h1>Lotus 79 Ground Effect, 1978</h1>
    <p class="ex1">
  <p>F1 cars of the 1970s and early 1980s had distinctive aerodynamics and innovations. One&#10 car that stood above the rest of the competition was the Lotus 79, which featured this&#10; technology known as ground effect. While its predecessor, the Lotus 78 was the&#10; first car to feature ground effect, the Lotus 79 proved to be more successful,&#10;propelling Mario Andretti to the 1978 world championship.</p>
  <p>The central tub was relatively narrow, with two large sidepods mounted on column is attached&#10; Unlike most sidepods of the time, which only accommodated radiators, these sidepods&#10; also housed two venturi tunnels, each surrounded by a carbon honeycomb. The&#10; tunnel channels airflow from the front of the car to the rear, allowing air to&#10;accelerated to extremely high speeds, creating low pressure areas towards the rear. This results&#10; in downforce being generated. Another advantage of Ground Effect was that the tunnels were&#10; placed next to the floor of the chassis, eliminating drag which would be caused by the rear wing.&#10; This design proved to be extremely successful, with Mario Andretti clinching the 1978 Championship. The FIA&#10; banned ground effect in 1983 as a result of the cars becoming dangerously fast and the&#10; effect of fatal crashes of Ronnie Patterson in 1978 and Gilles Villeneuve in 1982.</p>
