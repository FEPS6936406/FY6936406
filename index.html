    For many years, innovation has been the foundation to Formula One motor racing. Over 
    the past few decades, Formula One has had innovations that had revolutionised and shaped
    the sport and have been implemented since. However, a few innovations have been banned due
    to safety, the sole dominance of one team or cost effectiveness.

    This presentation will present F1’s ground-breaking innovations and how they
    helped teams to dominate and why they were banned as a result. We are going to be 
    covering Ground Effect, Active Suspension, Double Diffuser and Dual-axis Steering (DAS).

<h1><u>Lotus 79 Ground Effect (1978)</u></h1>
  <p style="font-size:1000%;">
  <p>F1 cars of the 1970s and early 1980s had distinctive aerodynamics and &#10;innovations. One car that stood above the rest of the competition was the &#10;Lotus 79, which featured this technology known as ground effect. While its &#10;predecessor, the Lotus 78 was the first car to feature this technology, &#10;the Lotus 79 proved to be more successful, propelling Mario Andretti to the &#10;1978 world championship.</p>
  <p>The central tub was relatively narrow, with two large sidepods mounted on both sides. Unlike most sidepods of &#10;the time, which only accommodated radiators, these sidepods also housed &#10;two venturi tunnels, each surrounded by a carbon honeycomb. The tunnel &#10;channels airflow from the front of the car to the rear, allowing air to &#10;accelerated to extremely high speeds, creating low pressure areas towards the rear. This results in downforce &#10;being generated. Another advantage of Ground Effect was that the tunnels were &#10;placed next to the floor of the chassis, eliminating drag which would be caused by the rear wing. &#10;This design proved to be extremely successful, with Mario Andretti clinching the 1978 Championship. The FIA &#10;banned ground effect in 1983 after the fatal crashes of Ronnie Patterson in 1978 and Gilles&#10; Villeneuve in 1982.</p>

  <h1><u>Williams FW14B Active Suspension (1992)</u></h1>
    <p style="font-size:1000%;">
    <p>The FW14B, which is known as F1’s most technologically advanced cars, &#10;which powered Nigel Mansell to the 1992 World Championship. The car &#10;had many innovations, such as traction control, anti-lock brakes and a &#10;powerful V10 engine. However, its groundbreaking active suspension &#10;was the main factor for the car’s dominance.</p>
    <p>The system used actuators instead of springs, programmed to adjust the &#10;height of the car, to deliver understeer (when the car does not turn enough) &#10;or oversteer (when the car’s rear end turns more than the front). This allows &#10;the car to quickly accelerate and carry its speed through the corners. There &#10;were also sensors that detected changes in speed, which &#10;prompted the system to constantly adjust its ride height. While active &#10;suspension did provide unrivalled pace in races, it added weight, &#10;complexity and felt unnatural to drive during the development of the car. &#10;Despite its championship level success in 1992 and later in 1993 on the&#10; FW15C, the system was banned in 1994, which aimed to reduce the amount of driver assists &#10;which could be catastrophic at speeds of 200mph.</p>

   <h1><u>Brawn GP's Double Diffuser (2009)</u></h1>
    <p style="font-size:1000%;">
    <p>The 2009 Formula 1 season will be known for a shock performance of a &#10;new financially struggling F1 team, known as Brawn GP, who went on to win &#10;both the drivers’ championship with Jenson Button and the Constructors &#10;Championship.</p>
    <p>The 2009 F1 regulations introduced major aerodynamic tweaks, resulting in &#10;cars being a lot slower and more competition. Ross Brawn, the &#10;team owner and senior engineer, found a clever loophole in the diffuser &#10;size by introducing an aerodynamic device called the Double Diffuser. This &#10;principle allowed air to channel underneath the floor of the car and onto &#10;the rear diffuser, creating downforce. Unlike most rear diffusers, the &#10;diffuser had a second upper channel at the rear, increasing the volume of &#10;air exiting behind the diffuser. This allowed the car to have a significant &#10;downforce advantage compared to rival teams. A few other teams such as &#10;Williams and Toyota did implement a similar concept but could not achieve &#10;the same level of success.</p>
    <p>Rival teams were not too impressed with Brawn GP’s dominance, with &#10;teams such as Ferrari and McLaren claiming that the double diffuser &#10;provided a significant advantage and, questioning the legality and fairness &#10;of the design, going into protest with the FIA. Although not banned directly &#10;by the FIA, all F1 teams agreed with the FIA not to use the double diffuser &#10;design for the 2011 season.</p>

   <h1><u>Mercedes W11 Dual-axis steering (DAS) system (2020)</u></h1>
    <p style="font-size:1000%;">
    <p>Mercedes was a dominant force in F1 and had stood above the competition &#10;since the introduction of the new turbo-hybrid engines from 2014 &#10;and have dominated for many years. &#10;While the main factor of Mercedes’ dominance was their powerful yet &#10;reliable engines, the DAS system was a feature that significantly helped its &#10;dominance. Introduced in 2020, DAS was a key feature which propelled &#10;Lewis Hamilton to his record-equalling 7th world championship, with &#10;Michael Schumacher.</p>
    <p>Normal F1 steering works like road cars, in the way that the steering &#10;column is attached to the steering rack via pinion gears. However, DAS &#10;adds another dimension to this system, by using a twin rack and pinion &#10;gear system, allowing the front wheels to turn independently to each other. &#10;This allows the angle of the front wheels to to be changed, which is known as &#10;toe.</p>
    <img src="https://www.racecar-engineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Toe-in.jpg" height = "450" width = "300">
    <img src="https://www.racecar-engineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Mercedes-W11-steering.jpg" height = "300" width = "400">
    <p>On the straights, there needs to be zero toe on the wheels, as this &#10;minimises drag, so the Mercedes drivers could pull back on the steering &#10;wheel, to perfectly align the front wheels. During braking, &#10;the driver can push back on the steering wheel, which changes the angle of &#10;the front wheels to toe-out, allowing smooth entry into a corner. While exiting &#10;a corner, the driver can pull back on the steering wheel to induce toe-in, &#10;allowing the outside tire to turn more, increasing grip and resulting in &#10;faster exit from corners. DAS also helped to maintain consistent tire grip &#10;during races</p>
    <p>The FIA initially deemed this system legal but protests from rival teams &#10;about the fairness and advantage of the system resulted in the FIA banning &#10;DAS for the 2021 season onwards.</p>
