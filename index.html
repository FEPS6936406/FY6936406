  For many years, innovation has been the foundation to Formula One motor racing. Over&#10; the past few decades,Formula One has had innovations that had revolutionised and shaped&#10; the sport for decades to come and have been implemented ever since.&#10; However, some innovations have been banned due to safety, the sole dominance of one team or cost effectiveness.

  <p>This presentation will present F1’s ground-breaking innovations and explain how &#10; they helped teams to dominate and why they were banned as a result.</p>


 
 
<h1><u>Lotus 79 Ground Effect, 1978</u></h1>
  <p style = "arial" size = "14">
  <p>F1 cars of the 1970s and early 1980s had distinctive aerodynamics and &#10;innovations. One car that stood above the rest of the competition was the &#10;Lotus 79, which featured this technology known as ground effect. While its &#10;predecessor, the Lotus 78 was the first car to feature ground effect, &#10;the Lotus 79 proved to be more successful, propelling Mario Andretti to the &#10;1978 world championship.</p>
  <p>The central tub was relatively narrow, with two large sidepods mounted on both sides. Unlike most sidepods of &#10;the time, which only accommodated radiators, these sidepods also housed &#10;two venturi tunnels, each surrounded by a carbon honeycomb. The tunnel &#10;channels airflow from the front of the car to the rear, allowing air to &#10;accelerated to extremely high speeds, creating low pressure areas towards the rear. This results in downforce &#10;being generated. Another advantage of Ground Effect was that the tunnels were &#10;placed next to the floor of the chassis, eliminating drag which would be caused by the rear wing. &#10;This design proved to be extremely successful, with Mario Andretti clinching the 1978 Championship. The FIA &#10;banned ground effect in 1983 as a result of the cars becoming dangerously fast &#10;and after the fatal crashes of Ronnie Patterson in 1978 and Gilles Villeneuve in 1982.</p>

  <h1><u>"Williams FW14B Active Suspension</u></h1>
    <p style = "arial" size = 16>
    <p>The FW14B, which is known as F1’s most technologically advanced cars, &#10;which powered Nigel Mansell to the 1992 World Championship. The car &#10;had many innovations, such as traction control, anti-lock brakes and a &#10;powerful V10 engine. However, the main factor for the car’s dominance was &#10;its groundbreaking active suspension.</p>
    <p>The system used actuators instead of springs, programmed to adjust the &#10;height of the car, to deliver understeer (when the car does not turn enough) &#10;or oversteer (when the car’s rear end turns more than the front). This allows &#10;the car to quickly accelerate and carry its speed through the corners. There &#10;were also sensors that detected acceleration and deceleration, which &#10;prompted the system to constantly adjust its ride height. While active &#10;</p>
